# burger
A burger eating app.

This app utilzes ORM, Express, handlebars, sql, and node.js to run. This was created as an assignment for UCB bootcamp class.
Looks very basic at first, but it's quite complicated to create with many files and routing. Also learning about CRUD
methods with this assignment.

How to Use:
1. Upon load, enter a burger name you would like to eat.
2. It will be saved under the "to be eaten" section.
3. A button with be next to each burger
4. Upon clicking the "eat" button, it will go under the "devoured" section.
5. In the "devoured" section, you can trash any burgers to remove it from the list.

Thank you for trying out my app!
